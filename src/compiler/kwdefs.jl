    @device [options] <generic circuit definition>

Entry for defining a generic quantum program. A generic quantum program is a function takes
a set of classical arguments as input and return a quantum program that can be furthur compiled
into pulses or other quantum instructions. The quantum program can return classical values from
device if `return` statement is declared explicitly, or it always return nothing, and mutates the
quantum register.

# Supported Semantics

- [`@ctrl`](@ref): Keyword for controlled gates in quantum circuit.
- [`@measure`](@ref): Keyword for measurement in quantum circuit.

The function marked by `@device` can be multiple dispatched like other Julia function. The only difference
is that it always returns a quantum circuit object that should be runable on quantum device by feeding it
the location of qubits and the pointer to quantum register.

# Options

- `mode`, compilation mode, default is `:hybrid`, see **Compilation Modes** for details.
- `target`, compilation target, default is `:julia`, see **Compilation Targets** for details.

## Compilation Modes

- `:hybrid`, default mode, allows arbitrary Julia code to work with quantum statements.
- `:pure`, all classical statements are disabled.
- `:qasm`, allows limited set of classical statements which is compatible to [openQASM](https://github.com/Qiskit/openqasm)

## Compilation Targets

- `:julia`, default target, compiles the program to Julia program.
- `:qasm`, compiles the program to [openQASM](https://github.com/Qiskit/openqasm).

# Example

We can define a Quantum Fourier Transformation in the following recursive way

```julia
@device function qft(n::Int)
    1 => H
    for k in 2:n
        @ctrl k 1=>shift(2Ï€/2^k)
    end

    if n > 1
        2:n => qft(n-1)
    end
end
```

This will give us a generic quantum circuit `qft` with 1 method.

"""
    @ctrl k <gate location>

Keyword for controlled gates in quantum circuit. It must be used inside `@device`. See also [`@device`](@ref).

"""
    @measure <location> [operator] [configuration]

Keyword for measurement in quantum circuit. It must be used inside `@device`. See also [`@device`](@ref).

# Arguments

- `<location>`: a valid `Locations` argument to specifiy where to measure the register
- `[operator]`: Optional, specifiy which operator to measure
- `[configuration]`: Optional, it can be either:
    - `remove=true` will remove the measured qubits
    - `reset_to=<bitstring>` will reset the measured qubits to given bitstring
